[1] "Read in train and test data"
Keep "Survived", "Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "Fare", "Embarked" as predictors
Convert Sex into numerical binary: male(0) and female(1)
Fill missing Embarked values with most frequent category S
Fill missing Age values grouped by Pclass and Sex
One-hot encode Embarked
Standardize Age and log-transform Fare
Train and fit logistic regression
Validation Accuracy: 0.7654
Prepare test data with the same procedures performed on the test data, fill empty fare cell with medium fare
Make prediction on test set...
Test Accuracy: 0.9402
